    "- Social media sentiment analysis has shown a significant impact on tech stock prices. Studies indicate that sentiment indicators extracted from social media can predict stock returns more effectively than traditional methods, due to their rapid response and authenticity [11] reference text.\n\n- The correlation between investor sentiment and stock prices is well-documented. For instance, sentiment indicators derived from Twitter posts have been found to correlate with stock returns, trading volume, and volatility. This suggests that positive or negative sentiments expressed online can influence market behavior [13] reference text.\n\n- The use of advanced text mining and machine learning techniques, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), has enabled more accurate extraction of investor sentiment from social media. These methods help filter out noise and focus on relevant information that affects stock prices, thereby improving prediction accuracy [18] reference text.\n\n- Sentiment analysis tools can identify the emotional tone of social media posts, categorizing them as positive, negative, or neutral. This categorization helps in understanding public perception and can be used to make data-driven decisions to improve brand sentiment and manage crises effectively [4] reference text.\n\n- Despite the benefits, sentiment analysis faces challenges such as handling noisy and unstructured data, sarcasm, and context-specific language. Combining manual listening with machine learning can help mitigate these issues and provide a more comprehensive sentiment analysis [5] reference text.",

    "**Strengths:**\n- **Global Reach & Market Leadership:** J.P. Morgan's operations span over 100 countries, showcasing its vast presence and market leadership. This global footprint not only underlines its capacity to serve a diverse clientele but also provides it with significant commercial opportunities on an international scale [6].\n- **Strong Financial Performance:** The company's robust financial health is evidenced by high profit margins, a strong balance sheet, and favorable capital ratios. In Q1 2024, it reported net revenue of $42.5 billion and net income of $13.4 billion, highlighting its financial prowess [6].\n- **Innovation & Research:** J.P. Morgan's substantial investments in research, amounting to $12 billion per year on technology, afford it cutting-edge market insights. This commitment to innovation and research significantly impacts the financial sector worldwide and aids clients in making informed investment decisions [10].\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **High Operational Cost:** Despite generating high revenue, J.P. Morgan's profit margins are impacted by its high operational costs. This aspect of its operations necessitates a focus on efficiency and cost reduction to improve profitability [20].\n- **High Reliance on One Region:** The bank's significant dependence on the US market is a notable weakness. This overreliance makes it vulnerable to regional economic downturns, which could have substantial impacts on its overall performance [17].\n\n**Opportunities:**\n- **Increase The International Presence:** Expanding its footprint beyond North America presents a significant opportunity for J.P. Morgan. By diversifying its market presence, the bank can mitigate risks associated with overreliance on a single region and tap into emerging markets for growth [17].\n- **Growth In The Global Credit Card Market:** The expanding global credit card market offers J.P. Morgan an avenue to leverage its financial services expertise and existing customer base to capture a larger share of this growing segment [17].\n\n**Threats:**\n- **Global Recession:** Economic downturns pose a significant threat to J.P. Morgan's operations, as they can lead to reduced investment activity and increased default rates among borrowers, impacting the bank's profitability [17].\n- **Changes In Regulations:** The financial industry is highly regulated, and changes in regulations can have a profound impact on J.P. Morgan's operations, requiring adjustments that could be costly or limit its business activities [17].",

    "- **Impact on Global Supply Chains and Cost Structures**: The imposition of new tariffs on Chinese products, particularly on electric vehicles (EVs) and solar cells, is expected to alter global supply chains and cost structures. Companies reliant on these imports may face increased production costs, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers. This shift could necessitate a reevaluation of supply chain strategies, with a focus on diversification or localization to mitigate tariff impacts [16].\n\n- **Sector-Specific Implications and Strategic Shifts**: The tariffs are likely to have a pronounced effect on specific sectors, notably the EV and renewable energy sectors. Investors and companies within these industries may need to adjust their strategies, potentially focusing on alternative markets or enhancing domestic production capabilities to circumvent tariffs. This scenario underscores the importance of understanding sector-specific dynamics and the geopolitical landscape when making investment decisions [16][21].\n\n- **Influence on International Trade Dynamics and Economic Growth**: The cumulative loss of trade between the U.S. and China, as well as the U.S. and the rest of the world, highlights the broader economic implications of trade policies. These losses could signal a shift towards deglobalization, with potential repercussions for global economic growth and international trade dynamics. Investors and companies may need to brace for a more fragmented global market, with increased emphasis on regional partnerships and alliances [20].\n\n- **Adjustments in Investment Strategies and Risk Management**: Given the unpredictable nature of trade policies, investors may need to adopt more dynamic investment strategies and enhance their risk management practices. This could involve diversifying investments across sectors and geographies less susceptible to trade disputes, as well as incorporating geopolitical risk assessments into investment analysis. The ability to quickly adapt to changing trade landscapes will be crucial for maintaining portfolio resilience [18].\n\n- **Long-term Structural Changes vs. Short-term Policy Fluctuations**: While tariffs and trade policies can introduce short-term volatility and uncertainty, it's essential to distinguish between these temporary fluctuations and long-term structural changes, such as the transition towards electric vehicles and renewable energy. Investors should focus on companies and sectors poised to benefit from these enduring trends, potentially offering growth opportunities despite the current policy-induced challenges [21][22].\n\nIn conclusion, the recent changes in trade policies underscore the complex interplay between geopolitics and global markets. Investors and companies must navigate this landscape with a nuanced understanding of the implications for specific sectors, supply chains, and investment strategies. Adapting to these changes while keeping an eye on long-term structural shifts will be key to achieving sustainable growth and resilience in an increasingly uncertain global market.",

They then launched the "Real Beauty" campaign, which celebrated and empowered women of all shapes, sizes, and colors. This not only resonated with their target audience but also greatly improved brand sentiment.',

It\'s crucial to double-check your mentions and leave some room for analytical error.\nHere\'s a good example from Netflix\'s Facebook page. Fans are obviously singing the praises of their programming, but they\'re also throwing in terms like "ugly," "cry" and "depressed" while doing so. If you saw those terms pop up in your mentions without context, it might be cause for alarm.\nSarcasm can likewise create confusion when it comes to sentiment analysis. When somebody Tweets "I love it when I lose my luggage after a nine-hour flight," they obviously aren\'t thrilled about their experience.\nAlthough sentiment analysis is going to be accurate most of the time, you\'re always going to have these sorts of outliers. A combination of manual listening and machine learning is ideal for getting the most "complete" sentiment analysis possible, which leads us to our next point.\nLet a sentimental analysis tool do the work for you\nThe sheer volume of conversations happening right now is reason enough to invest in a social media listening tool like Sprout.\nSprout\'s social listening capabilities eliminate most of the time-consuming tasks related to social listening.',

However, there are many obstacles when analyzing online text data, such as large volume, short text and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Few studies have applied topic models that can extract hidden information to investor sentiment analysis. Moreover, while analyzing the correlation between investor sentiment and stock return, the existing research often fails to probe into the source of stock excess return. Since the basic information of the company serves as an essential factor leading to the change in stock price, this paper aims to extract the implicit information from investors\' posts and filter out a large number of noises unrelated to stock price, such as complaints, to find out the information that primarily affects the trend of stock prices, explore the correlation between investor sentiment and stock prices, and further study the asymmetric effect, to put forward a new way to predict the stock price.',

With the development of research, it has become a new direction to extract sentiment indicators from online text data, which has the advantages of authenticity and rapid response. Many studies have applied unsupervised learning to topic models, but few have used the LDA model to analyze the sentiment of stock BBS texts. This paper attempts to use the classical text analysis model to study the relevance distribution of sentences and integrate sentences' inclination, degree and relevance to obtain the sentiment of sentences and eventually get the investors' propensity. Based on the model of Chen et al. (Chen et al., 2014, pp.1367-1403), it studies the relationship between excess return rate and investor sentiment in the United States and further explores the asymmetric effect of the market (Jin and Li, 2017, pp.157-173).\n3 Research method\n3.1 Theoretic model\nAccording to the above sentimental analysis results, and regarding Jin Dehuan et al., this paper constructs the following sentiment indicators by using the sentiment of the posts in each topic in the previous 20 days.",

      text: 'Investor sentiment has always been an active research topic in finance. In recent years, text mining, machine learning and sentiment analysis have been very fruitful, and researchers can extract valuable information from social platforms more promptly and accurately. Unsupervised learning avoids the subjective human selection of data while reducing the workload. This paper uses the primary model for the unsupervised learning total probability generative model LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation). Natural language processing and word-splitting tools empirically analyze text data from a well-known financial and stock information website. An attempt is made to explore the correlation with stock excess return. The significant findings are as follows. First, investor sentiment classified by theme is positively correlated with excess return. Second, different themes have different degrees of influence, with "broad market sentiment" affecting the short term, corporate development involving a long time, and "corporate dividends" affecting both. Third, there is an asymmetric effect of investor sentiment on excess return.\n1 Introduction',

      text: "In 2004, many scholars began to pay attention to the Internet search behaviour of households as a vital source of investor sentiment. Many authors demonstrated the effectiveness of such data in predicting investor attention and market returns (Da et al., 2015, pp.1-32). Most studies use Google Trends (GT) service to extract search volume data and investigate investor sentiment. The prediction ability of GT data for the two most popular volatility indicators: high-frequency volatility (RV) and Exchange Volatility Index (VIX), was studied. Both studies reported a positive and significant correlation between Internet search behaviour data and volatility indicators. Kristoufek (2013, pp.1-5) proposed a method of using Google Trends to search for portfolio diversification, which showed that the search query index was related to the risk of stocks. A weekly sentiment indicator was constructed relying on the Google search behaviour of households. (Gao et al., 2020, pp.549-580) studied how investor sentiment affected stocks around the world, adopted the results of competitive sports in the test, and ultimately showed that sentiment indicators were a reverse predictor of market returns at the national level. Internet search behaviour is a relatively new and promising indicator of investor sentiment. This type of sentiment data does not require additional information from other sources and can be used independently for scientific research.",

Some of the posts published by investors are logical, and some are empty. To achieve accurate text topic classification, it is necessary to construct a topic dictionary using the text mining method to train the topic model more specifically.\n2) This paper has less innovation in analyzing emotional orientation. It should be noted that even though the existing open-source tools can perform well in text sentiment analysis, there are still many deviations in the study of stock market texts. Because the stock market text contains many financial terms, universal sentiment analysis may not be able to identify such exceptional cases. Therefore, it's necessary to build a sentiment dictionary for the stock market in advance and combine it with open-source tools to improve the accuracy of sentiment orientation analysis.\n3) There are certain limitations in data samples. The data samples selected in this paper are not large enough. The chosen pieces are constituent stocks of the Shanghai Stock Exchange Index 50, without analysis of small-cap stocks or other sectors. Including small-cap stocks in future research is necessary to demonstrate the model's universality.",

Rather than focus on a one-off compliment or complaint, brands should look at the bigger picture of their audience's feelings.

In our previous commentary, we discussed the idea that investors needed new catalysts to push stocks past their previous highs. Last week, investors received those catalysts through cooler-than-expected consumer inflation updates and economic data that showed activity is slowing.\nThis week's look at April existing and new home sales and preliminary looks at May manufacturing and services activity should provide further color into how economic conditions have evolved since the end of Q1. FactSet estimates expect that both manufacturing and services activity this month held roughly static versus April levels, with both remaining in an expansionary state. Readings that show flat-to-slightly weaker manufacturing and services growth this month could be interpreted by investors as a positive and help push stock prices higher. Conversely, data that shows activity accelerating more than expected could push back on rate cut expectations, which could weigh on stock prices already at highs. Regardless of the market impact, we don't see this week's data or the latest FOMC Minutes on Wednesday changing the overall macroeconomic narrative, particularly against a heavy slate of speeches from policymakers this week.",

Of course, a little softening in the U.S. dollar over recent weeks hasn't hurt metal prices either.\nInflation pressures and interest rate policy keep investors on edge\nFrom a macroeconomic perspective, the one factor that has kept investors on edge all year, despite higher stock prices, has been concerns about persistent inflation pressures in the U.S. and its effect on interest rate policy.

      text: "However, though consumer inflation cooled more than expected last month, there is work ahead for overall consumer prices to move back to normalized levels, with the last mile of services inflation proving more entrenched than most expected at the start of the year. Thus, most of the market continues to see the first Federal Reserve rate cut not coming until September.\nIn addition to key updates on inflation, April retail sales came in weaker than expected, affected by seasonal factors, bad weather, and stress across low-income consumers. Also, April housing starts missed consensus forecasts, and regional Fed surveys showed continued stress in the manufacturing economy.\nBottom line: Consumer trends are showing further signs of normalization, which could help services inflation moderate in the months ahead. At the same time, the manufacturing side of the economy, as well as housing, remains strained by elevated rates, supply issues, price pressures, and weaker demand in certain areas. In our view, a soft landing for the economy may look a little messier than stock prices likely reflect today. Thus, maintaining a generally optimistic view of the future, but one that leans on a balanced portfolio approach, could be a prudent way to navigate the summer months.\nThe week ahead",

For the purpose of a simplified coding instruction, the direction of the reported change was coded. For example, if an export tax on maize is changed from 5% to 10%, the new policy is coded as 'higher'. However, if an import quota on maize is changed from 1 million tonnes down to 0.5 million tonnes, the new policy is coded as 'lower'. On the basis of these coded indicators, we developed a ruleset that shows for each type of trade policy and for each direction whether the trade policy change leads to higher or lower world market supply or higher or lower world market demand. For example, a higher export tax is expected to lower world market supply, while a lower import quota is anticipated to lower world market demand. The rules for classification of world market effects are shown in Supplementary Table 6.\nGrain price data",

International trade refers to exchanges of commodities, such as goods and services, across national boundaries, whereas trade policies comprise the standards, goals, rules and regulations that govern such exchanges38. On the basis of this general concept, agricultural trade policy is defined here as (1) an actual or potential decision by a national government or an institution controlled by the national government that concerns (2) transboundary exchange in one or more agricultural commodities. The first component puts the focus on national trade policies. Trade policies by the European Union are included, as they can be understood as decisions pertaining to a group of sovereign countries. Multilateral trade agreements, such as those of the World Trade Organization, are not considered. The definition further excludes decisions of private sector traders but includes decisions by state-owned enterprises.\nCase selection",

This choice is motivated by their importance in global agricultural production, consumption and commodity trade. These crops have in the past been subject to trade policy interventions, which results in an adequate level of variation in the data, which is sufficient for distinguishing the relative influence of different directions and types of trade policy intervention. We focus on a 12 year time period, from 2005 to mid-2017, which encompasses peaks in food prices observed for 2007 and 2008, as well as 2011, and periods of relatively stable or decreasing world market prices for grains since 2012. Currently available, comparable datasets only cover the time after 2008, for example the Global Trade Alert database39.\nAlthough our dataset also includes one further commodity (rice), we do not include this commodity in our analysis.

      text: "The subsequent weakness in global trade in 2023 reflects a less trade-friendly composition of global economic activity and the unwinding of the abovementioned exceptional factors. First, real GDP growth slowed more strongly in advanced economies (AEs) - where domestic demand is more import-intensive - than in emerging market economies (EMEs).[2] Second, while private consumption recovered sharply, private investment remained weak, reflecting a combination of tighter monetary policy, higher uncertainty amid intensified geopolitical tensions, and the unwinding of pandemic-related fiscal support measures. Estimates from import-demand models suggest that around half of the drop in global trade since 2022 can be attributed to these weaker fundamentals, particularly the lacklustre momentum in investment, which turned negative in the last quarter of 2022 (Chart D).[3] Beyond the role of fundamentals, the model suggests that other factors were at play in early 2023 (having started in late 2022), as indicated by the large negative residuals. These residuals are possibly related to the unwinding of the pandemic-specific factors mentioned above, including the fact that demand started to rotate back from trade-intensive goods towards services owing to the full relaxation of pandemic containment measures (Chart B), further weighing on trade momentum. This shift in consumption patterns is also consistent with the observed moderation in global manufacturing activity. As the manufacturing sector is highly trade-intensive, a sharp slowdown in manufacturing output is associated with a more pronounced decline in global trade than in global GDP.[4]",

      text: 'Looking ahead, the balance of risks to global trade is assessed as broadly balanced. Trade in goods and services could be boosted, inter alia, by an increased uptake of digital services - including those related to artificial intelligence. At the same time, the introduction of policies aimed at reshoring production (especially of critical goods and technologies) in the context of growing trade tensions, notably between the United States and China (for example, the US CHIPS and Science Act, China\'s dual circulation strategy and the US Inflation Reduction Act) could reduce trade volumes.[10] More generally, a fragmentation of trade along spheres of political influence could weigh on trade even as cyclical factors normalise. While there is thus far little evidence to suggest that deglobalisation has significantly hampered aggregate trade, the number of trade barriers has been rising since 2019, and soft indicators based on firms\' earning calls suggest that mentions of "reshoring" or "friend-shoring" have increased markedly since 2022 (Chart F).[11] Moreover, a recent European Central Bank survey of large EU corporate firms shows that over the next five years these firms expect to become more active in relocating operations in order to make their business model more resilient.[12]',

The supply bottleneck shock turned from negative to positive in early 2022 amid the gradual normalisation of supply disruptions, supporting trade even as demand began to moderate and the energy supply shock kicked in.[6] Falling domestic demand then caused a marked deceleration in global trade, notably in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Many mortgage interest rates will reset from April, and the increase in mortgage payments will weigh on household consumption. Importantly, many households have substantial home equity which reduces the potential for significant mortgage defaults. The labor market is very tight but is likely to ease through 2023 as labor demand moderates and labor supply increases as immigration resumes. This should keep wage pressure relatively contained. The Reserve Bank of Australia has recently signaled that it is near the end of its tightening cycle, and we believe that Australian government bonds offer attractive valuations.

We expect growth of around 4.5% next year, underpinned by government spending and some improvement in consumer standing. The property market will continue to be a watchpoint, and the potential for a global recession will weigh on exports. Inflation is likely to increase through the year but will remain below the target of 3%.\nChinese equities look cheap across most metrics, but we remain cautious for now, looking for clearer signs of a commitment to policy measures that will resolve the debt issues in the property market and meaningfully boost the economy.\nCanada\nThe Canadian economy is skating on thin ice, evident in the -2.4% contraction in GDP per-capita over the year ending the third quarter of 2023. An official recession has only been avoided due to immigration providing support for spending and growth. However, the per-capita decline indicates spending habits are souring largely due to escalating costs of home ownership.",

Many mortgage interest rates will reset from April, and the increase in mortgage payments will weigh on household consumption. Importantly, many households have substantial home equity which reduces the potential for significant mortgage defaults. The labor market is very tight but is likely to ease through 2023 as labor demand moderates and labor supply increases as immigration resumes. This should keep wage pressure relatively contained. The Reserve Bank of Australia has recently signaled that it is near the end of its tightening cycle, and we believe that Australian government bonds offer attractive valuations. The Australian dollar has seen further selling pressure given the divergence in central bank policy between the U.S. and Australia and now looks attractively valued.",

Restrictive monetary policy, sluggish growth in China and weak global trade will be headwinds. The positives are that consumer purchasing power is being lifted by robust wage growth and falling inflation. There also may be at least a temporary rebound in manufacturing activity as low global inventory levels are rebuilt, given Europeas larger exposure to manufacturing than other developed economies.\nThe region has been flirting with recession for the past year and it will be hard to avoid if the U.S. falls into recession. The other risk is that the European Central Bank (ECB) is slow to cut interest rates, as it is over-focused on backward-looking measures of inflation risk, such as wages growth.\nEurozone inflation is falling at a brisk pace, declining to 2.9% in October. Interest rate markets have priced just 100 basis points of ECB tightening in 2024. We expect that falling inflation and weak growth will see more easing than priced. Eurozone equities have been strong performers in 2023 but will battle tight monetary policy and recession risk in 2024.\nUnited Kingdom",
